# Introduction to Software Engineering
* The cost of developing the software is estimated to be P 400,000. Approximately, how much additional money would be needed for post delivery maintenance of the software?
* 6 months after delivery, a fault is detected in the software. Cost of fixing is Php 2,000,000. The cause of faults is an ambiguous sentence in the specification document. Approximately, how much would it cost to have corrected the fault during analysis phase?

* **Relative Costs**: The earlier we detect and correct a fault, the less it costs us
  * Coding: 1/6
  * Analysis&Design: 1/3
  * Testing: 1/2
  * **Of Fixing**: 80% Design, 20% Logic/Syntax
* **Relative Errors**
  * Syntax: 1/6
  * Programming&Logic: 1/3
  * Design: 1/2
