## Missing Stuff

## El Filibusterismo
* Cavite Mutiny
* Why is Rizal wearing an overcoat?
  * Statues of him were made and designed in Europe
  * Most pictures of Jose Rizal are always him wearing a coat
* **Two Main Characters**
  * **Basilio**
    * Returning from Spain to San Diego, adopted by Kapitan Tiyago
    * Becoming a doctor, considered an Ilustrado (Educated elite)
    * Representing naive Rizal/Ibarra
  * **Simone**

    * Head of the community, practiced slash-and-burn (**Kaingin farming**)
      * Stole his weapons, stole his bolo, stole his sticks then stole his land when he was unarmed
    * Talks about Land-Grabbing issue in the Philippines
      * When Rizal was in EU, the Dominicans were stealing the land of the Rizals and he couldn't do anything
      * Created a story that reflected that incident

## Idea of Revolution
* When Basilio was gonna get money buried in his mother's grave, he saw Simoun and they talked his backstory/plans of revolution
* They had nothing in common
* **Simoun's Plan for Revolution**
  * Be close to the governor general. Tell him to sequester lands and impose taxes, and create laws unfavorable to people (Remove all the posessions of people so they'd have nothing to fear)
    * *I have encouraged crime and cruelty to accustom the people to the thought of death. I fostered insecurity to drive them to seek the most desperate solutions. I cripplied business so that the country, impoverished and ruined, would no longer have anything to fear. I whetted appetites for public funds.*
  * Keep the ilustrados and principalia very wealthy
    * The poorest of the poor will notice the discrepancy between them getting bigger by the moment
  * Start the revolution by funding armed groups (supplying them with weapons and ammunition)
  * Blow up the house of Kapitan Tiyago
    * Organised a wedding party and invited the rich people to the house (poetic justice)
* **Basilio's Rebuttal**
  * *When I was about to achieve the spontaneous combustion of all this corruption, this loathsome accumulation of garbage, and when frenzied greed, taken unaware, was rushing about to seize whatever was at hand, like an old woman surprised by fire, you show up with your slogans of Pro-Hispanism*
  * Violence does not solve violence
  * *Only ambition is to alleviate the physical ills of my fellow citizens*
    * Simoun's retort: *You should save other sons from being mrudered, other mothers from being mad. Resignation is not always a virtue; it is a crime when it encourages oppression. There are no tyrants when there are no slaves.*
      * The reason we become slaves is becase we let them transform us in the manner (victims of our own crime)
    * *I do not mean to say that our freedom must be won at the point of the sword*
      * The sword no longer wields much influence on the destinies of our age; but I do not mean we must win our freedom by deserving it, improving the mind and enhancing the dignity of the individual, loving the just, the god, the great to the extent of dying for it.
    * *He refuses to envision the use of force and would seek his country's good "through education and progress"*
    * *Wrongs are not righted by other wrongs and for our misfortunes all of us have a share to blame*
* **Rizal remains confused**
  * Similar to Noli: doesn't provide a definitive answer
  * A window to Rizal's thinking about the revolution:
    * Peaceful revolution led by the Ilustrados
    * Violent revolution covered by venge and anger

## Rizal's Exile
* **He cannot start a revolution**: He doesn't have an army, so there's no way he can do anything
  * No reason to execute, so was exiled to **Dapitan, Zamboanga** because he was seen as a troublemaker
* **Became a doctor**: **Josephine Bracken** (her father's eyesight was degrading)
  * Josephine Bracken had a miscarriage
    * Fell from the stairs from Rizal surprising her
    * She was looking towards the nearby forest, saw an animal and got startled (Rizal pretending to be the animal)
  * Fetus buried underneath Rizal's house at Dapitan
* **Became a teacher**
* **Became an adviser**
  * Was visited by the KKK and asked what was needed to become successful (in Dapitan) 
  * Dangerous to stay in Zamboanga because he'd be implicated: decided to go to Cuba and become a military doctor
  * Revolution started on his way to Cuba
* **Got brought back to Fort Santiago/Intramuros, Manila**
  * Defended himself: claimed he was not part of the KKK and had no knowledge of the revolution
  * The Katipunan. Rizal was the honorary president of the Katipunan (same thing as Liga), and whose purpose were to proclaim the independence of the Philippines, make Rizal supreme leader and kill the Spaniards. His photograph was displayed in the Katipunan's headquarters. Shortly before the insurrection.
  * **Rizal's Rebuttals**: 
    * I know nothing of the Katipunan and have no relations or correspondence with them.
    * I don't know Andres Bonifacio either. 
    * Getting the photograph must have been easy. 
    * I gave no permission for the use of my name. 
    * Someone has alleged that I was the leader - what kind of leader is that who is not even consulted on plans, and is only given notice of them so that he can escape?
      * Somehow feels like what happened to Ibarra in Noli
      * Idea: Andres Bonifacio could've framed Jose Rizal in the plot of the Katipunan, where he has 2 choices - to join the revolution or to face death
        * If Rizal joins, people would follow and join as well (An ilustrado joining)
        * If Rizal dies, use him as a rallying cause
* **Rizal's Execution**
  * Big deal: First time they execute an ilustrado
  * Met his wife: Josephine Bracken (married for a few hours)
  * He wrote his final magnum opus: **Mi Ultimo Adios**
    * Smuggled the letter in an oil lamp and gave it to his sister
  * Last meal: Eggs/Cuevos. He peeled the hardboiled eggs and gave it to the rats, so they could have a feast when he died.
  * Walk to Luneta
  * **Did he know he was going to become a hero?**
    * Everything looked so rehearsed
    * His steps were really small
    * Managed to preserve his legacy - case in point with Andres Bonifacio where we know nothing about him
