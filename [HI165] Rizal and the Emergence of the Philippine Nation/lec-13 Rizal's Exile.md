# Rizal's Exile

## Exile
* **He cannot start a revolution**: He doesn't have an army, so there's no way he can do anything
  * No reason to execute, so was exiled to **Dapitan, Zamboanga** because he was seen as a troublemaker
* **Became a doctor**: **Josephine Bracken** (her father's eyesight was degrading)
  * Josephine Bracken had a miscarriage
    * Fell from the stairs from Rizal surprising her
    * She was looking towards the nearby forest, saw an animal and got startled (Rizal pretending to be the animal)
  * Fetus buried underneath Rizal's house at Dapitan
* **Became a teacher**
* **Became an adviser**
  * Was visited by the KKK and asked what was needed to become successful (in Dapitan) 
  * Dangerous to stay in Zamboanga because he'd be implicated: decided to go to Cuba and become a military doctor
  * Revolution started on his way to Cuba
* **Got brought back to Fort Santiago/Intramuros, Manila**
  * Defended himself: claimed he was not part of the KKK and had no knowledge of the revolution
  * The Katipunan. Rizal was the honorary president of the Katipunan (same thing as Liga), and whose purpose were to proclaim the independence of the Philippines, make Rizal supreme leader and kill the Spaniards. His photograph was displayed in the Katipunan's headquarters. Shortly before the insurrection.
  * **Rizal's Rebuttals**: 
    * I know nothing of the Katipunan and have no relations or correspondence with them.
    * I don't know Andres Bonifacio either. 
    * Getting the photograph must have been easy. 
    * I gave no permission for the use of my name. 
    * Someone has alleged that I was the leader - what kind of leader is that who is not even consulted on plans, and is only given notice of them so that he can escape?
      * Somehow feels like what happened to Ibarra in Noli
      * Idea: Andres Bonifacio could've framed Jose Rizal in the plot of the Katipunan, where he has 2 choices - to join the revolution or to face death
        * If Rizal joins, people would follow and join as well (An ilustrado joining)
        * If Rizal dies, use him as a rallying cause
* When he was in Dapitan, he wrote extensively about execution
  * Get a musket/gun, fired at a sack of kamote/potatoes
  * Praticed walking, marching, tying his arms, walking and turning
  * Perhaps planning something after his death

## Rizal's Execution
* Big deal: First time they execute an ilustrado
  * If an eucated ilustrado can get executed anyone can
* Met his wife: Josephine Bracken (married for a few hours)
* He wrote his final magnum opus: **Mi Ultimo Adios**
  * Smuggled the letter in an oil lamp and gave it to his sister
* Last meal: Eggs/Cuevos. He peeled the hardboiled eggs and gave it to the rats, so they could have a feast when he died.
* Walk to Luneta
* **Did he know he was going to become a hero?**
  * Everything looked so rehearsed
  * His steps were really small
  * Managed to preserve his legacy - case in point with Andres Bonifacio where we know nothing about him
* Lots of writers were kids at this time, and wrote about his death when they got older
  * Wore an overcoat, arms tied all the way to the elbow
* Lots of guards deployed that day: rumors that the KKK were planning an escape for Rizal
* **Lengthy Protocols**
  * Rizal, Indio soldiers, Spanish Soldiers, dog (mascot)
  * If the Indio soldiers didn't fire, Spanish soldiers would kill everyone. They wanted the Indio soldiers to be the ones to kill him
    * Only one soldier posessed the bullet - you wouldn't know if you fired the fatal shot
  * The whole Manila was put on red alert
  * Rizal did not want to be blindfolded: he's not a traitor (to whom?)
    * Shot at the back: Traitor to Spanish, loyal to Filipinos
    * Shot in front: Common criminal to Spanish
* **Procedure**
  * Drummers: 
  * Ajunte/Ahunte: Aim; Tiniente on the side raises sword, echoed 'Fuego' and Rizal was shot behind
  * Afterwards, Tieniente followed (Tiera de Gracia?) 'fire of grace': shooting Rizal in the head
  * Doctor goes to him and pronounces him dead
  * "Death to the traitor, Long live Spain", something de Cabiz was raised?
* Body was transported to an unmarked grave until his family discovered him
* Did not open a new chapter in the revolution; didn't strengthen or dampen
