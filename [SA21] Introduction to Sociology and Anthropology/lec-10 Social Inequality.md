# Social Inequality

## Social Stratification
* People or nations are divided into layers according to relative property, power and prestige 
* **Slavery**: Did not start because of racism, but three other factors
  * Debt: 
  * Crime: Instead of being killed, people become slaves
  * War: Enslavement of the Vanquished
* **Slavery in the New World**
  * Bonded Labor: People wanted to start a new life in another country
  * Ideology: Socially constructed intention 
    * Profitable to make people slaves for life
    * Colonists developed the view that their slaves were inferior
    * Led to racism, not racism as the cause of slavery

## Social Class
* Stratification systems based on salvery became very rigid with little or no movement from one group to another

## The Functionalist View
* Inequality helps societies survive: stratification of society is inevitable because some positions in society are more important than others
* How do we know that positions offer higher rewards are more important? [Social Construct]
